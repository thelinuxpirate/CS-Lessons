#+title: NvChad Basics, Configuration, & Lua

* NvChad
** File Structure
*NvChad* has a unique file-structure.
The way file-structures work in applications is that there are
certain directory paths that the application will look for its configuration files.

The default installation of NvChad will look something like:
#+begin_src sh
~/.config/nvim/
├── init.lua
├── lazy-lock.json
├── LICENSE
├── lua
│   ├── chadrc.lua
│   ├── configs
│   │   └── pluginnames.lua
│   ├── mappings.lua
│   ├── options.lua
│   └── plugins
│       └── init.lua
└── README.md
#+end_src

This is pretty simple to read for someone who understands the hierarchy of a file-tree.
But in short there are *three* main directories (folders) that you should look at.

- =lua/= Originally NeoVim's configured in its own language called 'VimScript'
  VimScript sucks ass & there is no point in learning its significance.
  Meanwhile Lua is more efficient & has actual use-cases in the real-world
  instead of its purpose to only configure an editor.

- =lua/configs/= This directory will be where you store the files that contain
  the lua code of your installed plugin's configurations.

- =lua/plugins/= This folder should only contain one file 'init.lua'.
  That file will contain all the code of the plugins you want installed
  in your configuration.

*** Whats an 'init' in programming?
*If* you're confused on why the word 'init' has been recurring this entire time
here is an overly-complex simplification of why that is the case:

*AI Summary:*

In short, "init" simplifies programming by automating setup processes, making code more efficient & easier to manage.


The word "init" appears frequently in programming because it is short for "initialize",
meaning to set up something before using it. It is commonly used in various contexts to simplify
& automate the setup process of different parts of a program.

Here’s how:
- In Configuration Files:
  Many tools, like NeoVim (init.lua or init.vim) or Git (init command), use "init" to
  signify the starting setup file or command.
  For example, git init sets up a new Git repository.

- In Programming Frameworks:
  Frameworks often use "init" files to handle setup tasks automatically,
  making code more organized & reducing the amount of repetitive setup work.

** How the hell do I use NeoVim anyways?
*NeoVim* is a very unique editor & the learning-curve may take awhile to master.
If you're able to stick with it you'll see immediate performance gains. (*TTP:* Trust The Process)

You can launch NeoVim by running =nvim= inside of a terminal (or the =vim= alias on some systems).
This will launch NeoVim in a blank 'buffer'.

Also if you've messed around with the editor you may have noticed that typing doesn't do jack shit,
& it just messed some stuff up. That's because NeoVim is a 'modal' editor.
*** Modal?
*AI Summary:*

A modal text editor is an editor that has different modes for different tasks.
Instead of always inserting text like a regular editor, a modal editor lets you switch between modes.

How it works in the context of NeoVim:


NeoVim has multiple modes, but the most important ones for beginners are:

    Normal Mode – Used for navigation & editing (e.g., moving the cursor, deleting words, copying & pasting).
    Insert Mode – Used for typing text like a traditional text editor.
    Visual Mode – Used for selecting text to copy, delete, or modify.


Examples:

    When you open a file in NeoVim, you're in Normal Mode. If you press i, you enter Insert Mode & can start typing.
    If you press Esc, you go back to Normal Mode, where you can quickly delete a word with dw (delete word) or move around efficiently with hjkl keys.
    To select a sentence, press v to enter Visual Mode, move the cursor, and then press y to copy it.

By separating typing, navigation, & editing into different modes, NeoVim makes it faster to work with
text once you learn the shortcuts, reducing the need for a mouse or arrow keys.
*** Commands, buffers, & why?
*You* can spawn commands while in Normal & Visual modes, by hitting the =:= key.
#+begin_src sh
# Quitting
:q -> Quit NeoVim
:q! -> Quit without saving changes

# Save Changes
:w -> Write changes to file
:wq -> Write changes to file & quit

# Misc
:e <PATH> ->

# Buffer + Window Management
:bd -> Kills current buffer
:bnext -> Switches to next buffer
:bprevious -> Switches to previous buffer

# [Splits = Windows]
:vsp -> Spawn a vertical split
:sp -> Spawn a horizontal split

:close -> Kills current window
:only -> Kills all windows but the current

# '|' = and
:bd | close -> Kill buffer & close window
:bnext | only -> Switches to the next buffer & kills rest of the open windows \
                 but the buffer it switched to
#+end_src

*AI Summary:*

NeoVim’s commands exist to provide a fast, efficient, & keyboard-driven workflow that minimizes reliance on a mouse and menus.
Instead of navigating through cluttered interfaces, users can execute powerful text-editing
& window-management actions with short, consistent commands.


*Why These Commands Exist & Their Use Cases*

   Quitting & Saving =:q, :w, :wq= – These ensure quick control over file management, allowing users to save or exit without interruptions.
    The :q! command is useful when discarding unwanted changes.

    Buffer & Window Management =:bd, :vsp, :sp, close, only= – NeoVim treats buffers (open files) & windows (views) separately, making multitasking smooth.
    Splitting windows =:vsp & :sp= lets users view multiple files side by side, while :only clears distractions by closing everything except the current window.

    Chaining Commands (|) – The ability to combine commands like =:bd | close= or =:bnext | only= streamlines workflows, reducing repetitive actions & keeping the workspace tidy.

*Why This Method Is Superior*

    _Speed & Efficiency_ – Keyboard-based commands are faster than clicking through menus.

    _Consistency_ – The command structure is predictable & follows a logic that applies across different actions.

    _Automation & Flexibility_ – Commands can be combined (=|=) or scripted for even greater control, reducing repetitive tasks.

By relying on commands rather than a GUI-based workflow, NeoVim empowers users with precise, efficient, & scalable text editing, making it a superior choice for power users & programmers.
