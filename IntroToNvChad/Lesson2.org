* NvChad
** File Structure
*NvChad* has a unique file-structure.
The way file-structures work in applications is that there are
certain directory paths that the application will look for its configuration files.

The default installation of NvChad will look something like:
#+begin_src sh
~/.config/nvim/
├── init.lua
├── lazy-lock.json
├── LICENSE
├── lua
│   ├── chadrc.lua
│   ├── configs
│   │   └── pluginnames.lua
│   ├── mappings.lua
│   ├── options.lua
│   └── plugins
│       └── init.lua
└── README.md
#+end_src

This is pretty simple to read for someone who understands the hierarchy of a file-tree.
But in short there are *three* main directories (folders) that you should look at.

- =lua/= Originally NeoVim's configured in its own language called 'VimScript'
  VimScript sucks ass & there is no point in learning its significance.
  Meanwhile Lua is more efficient & has actual use-cases in the real-world
  instead of its purpose to only configure an editor.

- =lua/configs/= This directory will be where you store the files that contain
  the lua code of your installed plugin's configurations.

- =lua/plugins/= This folder should only contain one file 'init.lua'.
  That file will contain all the code of the plugins you want installed
  in your configuration.

*** Whats an 'init' in programming?
If you're confused on why the word 'init' has been recurring this entire time
here is an overly-complex simplification of why that is the case:

*AI Summary:*

In short, "init" simplifies programming by automating setup processes, making code more efficient & easier to manage.


The word "init" appears frequently in programming because it is short for "initialize",
meaning to set up something before using it. It is commonly used in various contexts to simplify
& automate the setup process of different parts of a program.

Here’s how:
- In Configuration Files:
  Many tools, like NeoVim (init.lua or init.vim) or Git (init command), use "init" to
  signify the starting setup file or command.
  For example, git init sets up a new Git repository.

- In Programming Frameworks:
  Frameworks often use "init" files to handle setup tasks automatically,
  making code more organized & reducing the amount of repetitive setup work.
